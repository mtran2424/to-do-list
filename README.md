Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the files provided and copy them into a C# project directory (recommend doing this via Visual Studio 2019 or some other release)
Attach the provided icon through properties of the frame. Create files in the working directory called "Tasks.txt" and "Subjects.txt" and change the filepaths in
the source code files accordingly.
Build the project to create a .exe executable file. This can be found in bin/debug in the project directory. This can be placed anywhere as long as the source
code specifies the right file path.

How to Use

Launch the app and create a new task by providing the fields being asked for (subject, name, due date) and clicking the "Add" button.
View your tasks in the main container, where you can see the subject, task name, due date, and a checkbox.
Mark tasks as completed by checking the box next to the task and clicking "Clear". This removes the task from the container.
